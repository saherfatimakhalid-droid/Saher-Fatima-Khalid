# Final Project â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization

## Overview

This project was completed as part of the final assignment for my data analysis course. The goal was to select a dataset of personal interest, explore it using R, and present findings through clear visualizations and statistical analysis.

I chose a dataset related to **aircraft design and performance characteristics**. The project explores trends such as how factors like **wing span, fuselage length, altitude, and material type** relate to **operational life and durability**.

## Key Features

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

  * Summary statistics and distribution plots
  * Correlation analysis

* **Visualizations (6+ types)**

  * Scatter plots, histograms, boxplots, bar charts, line plots, correlation heatmap

* **Statistical Tests**

  * ANOVA and Chi-square tests

* **Regression Analysis**

  * Linear model exploring predictors of operational life

* **Executive Summary & Conclusion**

## Results Snapshot

* Aircraft with **greater wingspan** tended to show improved durability.
* **Material type** significantly influenced operational life (ANOVA results).
* Regression analysis highlighted **altitude and fuselage length** as strong predictors.

## Tools Used

* **R** 
* **R Markdown**
